      "Payments using non-Russian bank cards are accepted through specialized payment services.",
      "1.2 When to pay for lessons",
      "Students are responsible for keeping track of their balance in their personal account.",
      "Lessons scheduled for the next day must be paid for by 9:00 p.m. (Moscow time).",
      "If the balance in the personal account is zero at 9:00 p.m., the lessons are canceled, and the teacher's time on that day will be taken by another student or used at their discretion, even if the balance was replenished afterwards. If the balance has been replenished, only in exceptional cases, by agreement with the teacher, if they are available, the canceled lesson may be held at the same or another time.",
      "1.3 Cancellations of unpaid lessons may occur with a delay.",
      "Keep your balance positive at all times to avoid lesson cancellations. We recommend paying for several lessons in advance. A zero balance is a signal to the school that the student does not plan to continue studying.",
      "1.4 If you want to change your class schedule",
      "To change your schedule, you must notify your teacher of the new dates and times in the study chat with the @ symbol 24 hours in advance.",
      "1.5 If you miss or reschedule a class on a one-time basis",
      "You are allowed to reschedule or cancel up to three classes per calendar month for any reason without losing credit, provided that you notify the teacher and administrator in the study chat at least two hours before the class. The notification must contain precise information about which class you are requesting to cancel or reschedule and at what time, and the teacher must be tagged with the @ symbol in the chat.",
      "If the request to change the time of the lesson is made on the same day it was scheduled, the teacher will decide whether such a rescheduling is possible depending on their schedule, workload, and personal plans.",
      "If there are more than 3 postponements or absences in a calendar month, the amount equal to the cost of the lesson will be deducted from the balance for each subsequent absence. If the balance is zero, another student will be assigned to the teacher's regular schedule. You can continue studying with your teacher according to a different schedule proposed by the school.",
      "Rescheduling or scheduling an additional new lesson is possible no earlier than 24 hours after the student has notified the school in the study chat and only if there is at least 1 lesson remaining on the balance and the teacher is available to conduct such a lesson.",
      "In case of frequent cancellations or non-payment for lessons, at the discretion of the school administration, classes will be suspended, the teacher's schedule will be freed up, and another student may be assigned to them. The student will be offered a different study schedule and/or a different teacher.",
      "1.6 Long-term suspension of classes for less than 2 weeks",
      "If you take a break from studying for up to 2 weeks, your lesson schedule and balance will be retained if you notify the teacher in the study chat using the @ symbol no later than 9:00 p.m. on the day before the next scheduled lesson.",
      "1.7 Long-term suspension of classes for more than 2 weeks",
      "If you take a break for more than 2 weeks, your schedule is not guaranteed. The teacher's schedule will be adjusted and the vacant time will be taken by another student. If you notify us of the exact date of your return before leaving, the school will do its best to ensure that your teacher can resume teaching you.",
      "1.8 Suspension during public holidays",
      "It is permissible to cancel classes during official public holidays in the country where the student is located. To do this, you must inform the teacher by 9:00 p.m.",
      "1.9 Suspension of classes at the initiative of the teacher or school",
      "The school has responsible teachers who always strive to work according to the schedule and not miss classes. However, a teacher may fall ill or encounter an unforeseen situation. The teacher may cancel classes on any day and at any time, and he or she or the administrator will inform the student in the study chat. The school may offer another teacher as a replacement at the same or another time, if possible, and the student requests such a replacement. If the cancellation is initiated by the teacher or the school, the student's schedule and balance will not change.",
      "1.10 Being late or not showing up for a lesson",
      "If the student does not show up for the lesson within the first 15 minutes and does not contact the teacher in the study chat, the teacher will end the lesson, leave the online room, and the lesson will be considered to have taken place. If the teacher is notified of the delay within the first 15 minutes, they will wait for the student for the remainder of the lesson. In this case, the lesson will end at the scheduled time, even if it lasted only a few minutes."
